## üñ•Ô∏è Backend Deployment (Railway)

### Repository Setup
- [ ] Code is pushed to GitHub
- [ ] `backend/` folder contains all necessary files:
  - [ ] `app/main.py` - FastAPI application
  - [ ] `requirements.txt` - Python dependencies
  - [ ] `Procfile` - Railway start command
  - [ ] `railway.json` - Railway configuration
  - [ ] `.env.example` - Environment template

### Railway Deployment
- [ ] Created new Railway project
- [ ] Connected GitHub repository
- [ ] Selected backend folder as root directory
- [ ] Set environment variables:
  - [ ] `GROQ_API_KEY=your_actual_key`
  - [ ] `DEBUG=False`
  - [ ] `HOST=0.0.0.0`
  - [ ] `PORT=8000`
  - [ ] `ALLOWED_ORIGINS=*`
- [ ] Deployment completed successfully
- [ ] Railway URL obtained: `https://[your-app].up.railway.app`

### Backend Testing
- [ ] Health check works: `curl https://[your-app].up.railway.app/health`
- [ ] Summarization works: 
  ```bash
  curl -X POST https://[your-app].up.railway.app/summarize \
    -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
    -d '{"text": "Test text to summarize"}'
  ```
- [ ] No errors in Railway logs

## üåê Frontend Deployment (Vercel)

### Repository Setup  
- [ ] Frontend code is ready:
  - [ ] `frontend/src/App.tsx` - Main React component
  - [ ] `frontend/package.json` - Dependencies and scripts
  - [ ] `frontend/vercel.json` - Vercel configuration
  - [ ] `frontend/.env.example` - Environment template

### Vercel Deployment
- [ ] Created new Vercel project
- [ ] Connected GitHub repository
- [ ] Set root directory to `frontend`
- [ ] Verified build settings:
  - [ ] Framework: Vite
  - [ ] Build Command: `npm run build`
  - [ ] Output Directory: `dist`
- [ ] Set environment variables:
  - [ ] `VITE_API_URL=https://[your-railway-app].up.railway.app`
- [ ] Deployment completed successfully
- [ ] Vercel URL obtained: `https://[your-app].vercel.app`

### Frontend Testing
- [ ] Frontend loads without errors
- [ ] Text input field works
- [ ] "Summarize Notes" button works
- [ ] API connection successful (check browser console)
- [ ] Actual summarization works end-to-end
- [ ] Error handling works (try very short text)
- [ ] Mobile responsive design works

## üîó Integration & Final Steps

### Backend CORS Update
- [ ] Updated Railway environment variables:
  - [ ] `FRONTEND_URL=https://[your-vercel-app].vercel.app`
  - [ ] `ALLOWED_ORIGINS=https://[your-vercel-app].vercel.app,http://localhost:5173`
- [ ] Backend redeployed automatically
- [ ] CORS errors resolved

### End-to-End Testing
- [ ] Visit your Vercel URL
- [ ] Paste long text sample
- [ ] Click "Summarize Notes"
- [ ] Verify AI summary appears
- [ ] Test on mobile device
- [ ] Test error scenarios
- [ ] Performance is acceptable (<5 seconds)

### Documentation Update
- [ ] Updated README.md with live URLs
- [ ] Shared project URLs:
  - Frontend: `https://[your-app].vercel.app`
  - Backend: `https://[your-app].up.railway.app`
  - API Docs: `https://[your-app].up.railway.app/docs`

## üéØ Production URLs

After successful deployment, fill in your actual URLs:

| Service | URL | Status |
|---------|-----|--------|
| **Frontend** | `https://____________.vercel.app` | [ ] Working |
| **Backend** | `https://____________.up.railway.app` | [ ] Working |
| **Health Check** | `https://____________.up.railway.app/health` | [ ] Working |
| **API Docs** | `https://____________.up.railway.app/docs` | [ ] Working |

## üîß Environment Variables Used

### Railway (Backend)
```bash
GROQ_API_KEY=gsk_...
DEBUG=False
HOST=0.0.0.0
PORT=8000
ALLOWED_ORIGINS=https://your-frontend-url.vercel.app,http://localhost:5173
FRONTEND_URL=https://your-frontend-url.vercel.app
```

### Vercel (Frontend)
```bash
VITE_API_URL=https://your-backend-url.up.railway.app
```

## üö® Common Issues & Solutions

### Backend Issues
- [ ] **Build fails**: Check `requirements.txt` has all dependencies
- [ ] **Runtime error**: Check Railway logs, verify environment variables
- [ ] **API timeout**: Check Groq API key is valid and has credits

### Frontend Issues
- [ ] **Build fails**: Check TypeScript errors, verify all imports
- [ ] **CORS error**: Update backend `ALLOWED_ORIGINS` with correct frontend URL
- [ ] **API connection fails**: Verify `VITE_API_URL` is correct

### Integration Issues
- [ ] **No response from API**: Check both services are deployed and running
- [ ] **Error 500**: Check backend logs for detailed error information
- [ ] **Error 404**: Verify API endpoints match frontend requests

## üéâ Success Criteria

Your deployment is successful when:
- ‚úÖ Frontend loads at Vercel URL
- ‚úÖ Backend responds at Railway URL  
- ‚úÖ End-to-end summarization works
- ‚úÖ Error handling is graceful
- ‚úÖ Mobile experience is good
- ‚úÖ No console errors
- ‚úÖ Performance is acceptable

## üîÑ Post-Deployment

### Optional Enhancements
- [ ] Set up custom domain for frontend
- [ ] Configure monitoring/alerts
- [ ] Set up analytics
- [ ] Add error tracking (Sentry, etc.)
- [ ] Optimize performance

### Maintenance
- [ ] Monitor Railway usage (stay within free tier)
- [ ] Monitor Groq API usage
- [ ] Check for updates to dependencies
- [ ] Monitor application performance
